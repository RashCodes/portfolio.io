                DECLARATION

              </li>
              <li>These days, all organizations have grown construction sites every moment with their construction equipment, but no one pays attention to the workers inside the construction sites, especially the purchase representatives inside the construction sites for small companies in some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, so there is a need to build a system that helps the purchase’s representatives, and warehouse workers under the supervision of the small construction site groups. It can also help the designer inside the construction sites identify and select the things required for the final finishes of the apartments. The problem we have is that we cannot provide enough time to try to record all the information through the manual process, so the purchase’s representative cannot balance the time and responsibility of the general supervisor, designer, or engineer. This means that the purchase suffers from great pressure using the manual process. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to build a well-automated system that is easy to use to transform the manual process into a digital process, as there is no error rate in completing orders sent from the purchasing representative, no matter how pressured.</li>
              <li>
                PROBLEM STATEMENT
              <p>I. It is difficult for the "purchases representative" to find suitable items due to the many available warehouses via manual processes.</p>
              <p>II. It is difficult to have effective info between the "purchases representative" and the "warehousemen".</p>
              <p>III. It is hard to do the process manually, such as storing data and calculating the spent.</p>
              </li>

               PROJECT OBJECTIVES
              <p>I. To design a user-friendly “PR-Speedy Pickup” application that can change from the manual process of “purchase representative” and "warehousemen" to an automated system.</p>
              <P>II. To develop a "PR-Speedy Pickup" application that includes features such as attaching new items, ordering items to be prepared, and sending info via a description box.</P>
              <P>III. To develop a "PR-Speedy Pickup" application that includes a feature such as calculating the prices of the requested items.</P>
